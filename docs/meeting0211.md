## Aspects of the dataset

Features:
`Temperature`: the temperature data in Celsius for each mouse at each minute for the duration of 2 weeks.
`Activity`: the activity level for each mouse at each minute for the duration of 2 weeks.

Considerations:
estrus cycle
light-dark cycle
sex: male vs female mice

## Question to Answer

We notice that the trend of the temperature data is bi-modal. For the first peak, count of temperature values for female mice and male mice are significantly different around range 36.4 to 36.8 (where female temperature counts are a lot higher), and the second peak are located slightly different (male at 37.5 and female at 38). We want to explore the reasoning behind this difference through explorations in their daily cycle, and potentential interactions to their activity level, as well as estrus cycle in female mice.
